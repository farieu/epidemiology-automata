# 📚 SEIR Model Simulation of Measles with Celullar Automata

**Project repository for the subjects Mathematical-Computational Modeling applied to Epidemiology and Fundamentals of Cellular Automata, under the guidance of Professor Jones Albuquerque.**

## 🦠 About the Project 
This repository contains an epidemiological simulation using cellular automata to model the spread of measles based on the SEIR model. The simulation considers variable incubation periods, spatial interactions, and the impact of herd immunity, providing a visual representation of disease transmission dynamics.

The model incorporates:

- 🏢 **Moore neighborhood** interactions to simulate close-contact transmission.

- ⏳ **Variable incubation times**, mimicking real-world infection variability.

- 📊 **Graphical visualization** of outbreak progression across multiple iterations.

- 📍 **Epidemiological parameters** based on real-world measles data.
